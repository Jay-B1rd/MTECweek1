    [Episode begins on Christmas Eve.]
    Narrator: Our story begins on Christmas Eve at a humble little charity called Smiling Friends. [Scene shows Smiling Friends Inc. on Christmas Eve.] Here works a group of gleeful critters dedicated to making the world a better place. [Scene transitions to the titular Smiling Friends in the office full of Christmas decorations with Pim trying to hang up Christmas lights by standing on a ladder, Charlie sits in a chair, on the table, and plays the game Rust on his laptop which the latter is next to some energy drinks, Allan carries a tray of Christmas cookies out of the oven, and Glep sleeps in his beanbag chair with a mug of hot chocolate and a plate with a half-eaten cookie shown.] They were all in the holiday spirit. [Charlie drinks one of his energy drinks, and continues to play Rust.] That is, except for one nasty, yellow one.
    Pim: Charlie, can you help me hang these lights up?
    Charlie: Uh, yeah, just give me a sec, man.
    Pim: Oh, come on, let’s spice up the office with these funny decorations.
    Charlie: Dude, what difference does it make? We get off work in, like, five minutes.
    [The Boss opens the door and appears in the office in a Christmas uniform.]
    The Boss: Hey, boys, before you scurry out of here, I got a last-minute job for you. This job is for me, your favorite character, the Boss. I just need a Christmas tree for the office. Ha, ha. [winks]
    Pim: [Climbs down the ladder.] That sounds marvelous. A Christmas adventure!
    Charlie: Come on, seriously? It’s Christmas Eve, man. I was just about to go home.
    Pim: It’ll be fun, Charlie. One last job to end the year.
    [The scene transitions to a snowy transition where the Smiling Friends are shown walking out of a car, and they start walking through a snowy landscape of hills and trees.]
    Pim: Oh, this is gonna be great. I can’t wait to find the perfect Christmas tree. Which one do you guys wanna get? There’s - Oh, there’s a bunch.
    Charlie: Yeah. Look, look, uh, let’s just make it quick. I really don’t want to be here all night.
    Pim: What’s up with you today, Charlie?
    Charlie: Huh? What- What are you talking about?
    Pim: I don’t know. You just - I don’t know. It seems like you’re agitated or something.
    Charlie: I’m not - I’m not agitated, Pim. I just don’t want to be working on Christmas Eve. And I think that’s a pretty reasonable position to have.
    Pim: When you’re in this mood, I don’t know if you realize, but it actually affects everyone else’s mood. It - it brings us down a bit.
    Charlie: Wait. Hold on. Hold- No, no. It affects you. Nobody else- , are you affected by whatever- whatever is supposed to be happening?
    Allan: I don’t really care.
    Charlie: Are you affected?
    Allan: I just want to find a tree.
    Charlie: Okay. So, in other words, he’s not affected. See, Pim, here’s the thing-just because you are, you know, very positive and cheery about everything, does not mean everyone else has to conform to that.
    Pim: I’m just saying, it seems like you’re often in this mood, like, it’s not just a one-off thing. It seems like you’re often like this.
    Charlie: What do you mean? What is that - What is that supposed to mean?
    Pim: Well, it was the same with Desmond, wasn't it? I had to get you motivated for that.
    Charlie: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
    Pim: Charlie, you didn’t want to do that job, and I had to get you motivated, like I often have to do.
    Charlie: Okay. Yeah, Desmond was how many months ago. Also, dude, that’s a weird thing to bring up specifically, because that was one of the instances where you were not in the best mood. So the fact that you’re roping me…into asking me.
    Pim: Charlie, I’m just bringing stuff up, and it’s not just Desmond.
    Charlie: Oh.
    Pim: It’s - it’s every job we do. You never want to do anything. It sometimes just gets a bit exhausting. That’s all I’m saying.
    Charlie: You know, I could do the same thing back to you. I could throw stuff at you…
    Pim to Charlie: Okay, say it. Tell me. I’d love to say what people are saying about me.
    [The Smiling Friends approach a Christmas tree to chop down with an axe.]
    Allan: Okay, how about this tree?
    Pim: Yeah, it’s fine. Let’s just do it.
    Charlie: It looks fine to me.
    Allan: Alright. Pim, do you want to chop it down?
    Pim: Yeah, sure.
    Charlie: No, no, you know what? Let me do it. [Charlie grabs the axe from Allan.] I’ll do it. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.
    [Charlie starts chopping down the tree with the said axe.]
    Pim: Careful, Charlie.
    Charlie: Pim, I'm just helping out, right? Something that I never do, according to you, right? Oh, is this- is just putting anyone in a bad mood, huh? Is this putting anyone in a bad mood?
    [The Christmas tree that Charlie chops down ends up falling onto him, and even kills Charlie in the process. Pim, Allan and Glep are all stunned with silence.]
    [A sequence of rapid images play. An explosion and lighting cracking are also heard from an explosion and lighting shown respectively in the sequence.]
    [Charlie groaning]
    [The scene shows Charlie waking up in Hell and seeing volcanoes in the background. He also sees the closeup of a Demon.]
    Demon: [Yelling] Welcome to H-e-double hockey sticks! I am your master now. [Shows Charlie the Hell mattress.] There is your Hell mattress. [Shows Charlie the Hell Toilet.] This is your Hell toilet. [Shows Jeremy to Charlie.] And this is Jeremy, your only form of Hellish entertainment.
    Jeremy: [Screams] Blblblblblblblblbll!
    Charlie: Dude, if you do that again, I’m gonna punch you, I’m not kidding.
    Demon: Well, you’re gonna be here forever, Charlie, so get used to it! Blaaahhh!
    [Fiery Hell background peels off, and falls onto the Hell Mattress and Toilet respectively.]
    Charlie: Uh, I thought this was Hell. Where’s the actual fire?
    Demon: Alright. Alright, you’ve worn me down. This place isn’t what it used to be? To be honest, Satan’s been down in the dumps lately, and he hasn’t been managing things well here. As a result, Hell’s literally frozen over.
    Charlie: Down in the dumps? Wait, I-I think I could actually help him. That’s, like, what I do. I’m a smiling friend.
    Demon: But if you try to leave, I’ll pierce you with my evil pitchfork. Nah!
    Charlie: That’s made out of cardboard, man.
    Demon: You know what? I put a lot of work into this thing. Just-just leave. I actually don’t want you here now. Just-just get out of h-Get out of here. Go away. [Crying] Go away. [Charlie leaves the room.]
    [Demon sniffles, and his crying continues]
    [Charlie opens the door, and exits the room.]
    [The next scene shows Hell covered with snow and ice. Two of Satan’s Devil Minions are seen together. One of them talks to the other.]
    Charlie: [Sighs] Alright. Now I just need to find the devil.
    [Charlie hears his grandma.]
    Charlie’s Grandma: Oh, my beautiful grandson.
    Charlie: Grandma, what are you doing here?
    Charlie’s Grandma: Oh, I cursed and said Damn! In 1958 when I saw your grandfather being shot in the head by that rotten burglar.
    Charlie: That seems a little bit unreasonable. I don’t think you should be in Hell for that. Uh, Grandma, you wouldn’t happen to know where I could find Satan, would you?
    Charlie’s Grandma: Oh, of course. Just go down that scary hole right there. [She points her finger to a large hole.] You’ll find him at the bottom circle of Hell.
    Charlie: Oh, sweet. Thanks, Grandma.
    Charlie’s Grandma: Oh, [Brings out a hard candy for her grandson.] you should have a scrumptious piece of hard candy for the journey, Charlie. Here you go.
    Charlie: Oh, no, thank you, Grandma. I’m fine. Thank you, though.
    Charlie’s Grandma: More for me. [laughs]
    [Charlie’s Grandmother sucks the hard candy in her mouth.]
    Christmas Hell Song: [Charlie walks through an icy Hell.] Well, it’s Christmas in H-e-double-I.
    [A flying Demon picks up a Devil, and throws him off a cliff.]
    Devil: Aaahh!
    Christmas Hell Song: [Two large muscular Demons are shown in the background while Charlie crawls down ledges.] Yeah, the damn and the doom. Are ringing those jingle bells. [Charlie walks on a frozen lake of skeletons underneath the ice.] Take a bit of misery and it upon the tree. [A Giant Snake is shown slithering in the icy lake.] [Charlie walks on a bridge.] Cause down here. The Holidays last for eternity. [Charlie sees flying Demons heading towards him on the bridge.] [He runs away from the bridge.] [Charlie hides behind a melting piece of ice from a fire-breathing monster which melts the said ice.] There’s fiery frustration. There’s all kinds of aggravation. [The fire-breathing monster gets eaten alive by a demon-like monster. Charlie promptly runs away.] [Charlie passes through a large swarm of demon-like Bliblies] There’s a thousand points of never-ending pain. [Charlie sees a large Cacodemon-like demon.] There’s no better destination for an excellent celebration. [Charlie passes the large demon.] H-e-double-I. [Charlie climbs a large hill of icy rocks. Camera views a large frozen lake of heads.]
    [Wind whistling]
    Charlie: [Sighs] Okay. I’m almost there. I think the biggest surprises are behind me.
    Jeremy: [Screams] Blblblblblblblblbll!
    [Charlie punches Jeremy in the stomach.
    [Jeremy groans]
    Charlie: Dude, I warned you. I said I was gonna do that if you did that again.
    [Charlie leaves]
    [Jeremy’s groaning continues]
    [Howling is heard.]
    [Charlie walks through a frozen lake of heads and faces.]
    Hell Face: You’re never leaving!
    Hell Face 2: This is your final resting place.
    Hell Face 3: Time’s up, Charlie.
    Frozen Head: I’m sorry. I couldn't think of anything to say.
    Charlie: Nah, there’s no pressure, man. It’s all good. You didn’t have to- You didn't have to say anything.
    [Charlie approaches the large door of Satan’s room.]
    Charlie: Alright. Here I go.
    [Charlie knocks on the door.]
    Satan: [Demonic voice] What is your business?
    Charlie: Uh…to make you smile.
    [Satan’s door opens]
    [Charlie walks into Satan’s room, and sees the Devil playing Rust on one of his computers.]
    Satan: [Normal voice] What’s up?
    Charlie: Not much, dude. So I heard that you were having some trouble managing Hell or something like that. Uh, so what’s going on?
    Satan: Uh, yeah, I don’t know. It’s just becoming too much damn work. You know? Look, I’ve got 100 emails from a G-mail account. There’s a bunch of, like, bullshit paperwork I’ve got to do, which I’ve been putting off. And, you know, on top of all of it, the worst thing is, you know, I don’t get paid until the end of my job, which is eternity, it’s forever, so it’s eternity. So I just don’t even care anymore. I just don’t care anymore.
    [Goes back to playing Rust on his computer.]
    Charlie: I know it might seem a little bit silly, but I think I could help cheer you up and get Hell back to normal. I really wasn’t ready to die yet. I was thinking that if I succeeded, you could send me back to Earth.
    Satan: Alright. Deal.
    Charlie: Okay, well, I guess off the top of my head, have you tried, uh-
    [A notification is heard from Satan’s cellphone.]
    Satan: I’m sorry. One second. Yeah, it’s unlocked. You can come in.
    [The door opens to reveal a large Salty’s bag being pushed into the room by a MeepEats Deliveryman.]
    Satan: Just right over- Yeah, right over there. That’s fine. Yep.
    MeepEats Deliveryman: I didn’t know if it were this place or the one nex--
    Satan: I think it’s just something to do with the way the address shows up in the app. You know, it’s not a problem. Don’t even worry about it.
    MeepEats Deliveryman: Okay. Yeah. I just, uh…I just need to take a picture of the food really quickly.
    Satan: Yeah. Yeah. No, all good.
    [Satan puts down the large Salty’s bag.]
    [MeepEats Deliveryman takes a picture of the Salty's bag on his cellphone. A camera shuttering clicking sound is heard.]
    MeepEats Deliveryman: Okay, thank you, sir.
    Satan: Yeah, thanks.
    MeepEats Deliveryman: Goodnight.
    Satan: You have a good one.
    MeepEats Deliveryman: Happy Holidays.
    Satan: Merry Christmas.
    [MeepEats Deliveryman closes the door.]
    [Satan grabs a wrapped burger from Salty's bag.]
    Satan: I hope they didn’t forget the straw again. They always do. [Grabs a box of unhealthy french-fries out of the bag.] [He then finds a soda cup in the bag without a straw.] And they did. Great, great. They forgot it. Cool. Just what I wanted. [Grabs the wrapped burger, and unwraps it.] Exactly-exactly what I wanted, actually. Cool. [Eats a very unhealthy burger.] Sorry. You were saying something?
    Charlie: No, no, it’s- Yeah, whatever. Uh, anyways, as I was carrying, it seems like you’re unmotivated to do things because you’re stuck in a loop of short-term dopamine rushes. Why don’t you just try to start small at first, like, like, eating healthier or something?
    Satan: Are you seriously criticizing me?
    Charlie: No, no, no, not at all. I’m just trying to help, man.
    Satan: You put me in a worse mood that I was in earlier. [Satan grabs a vape pen, and exhales it.] Oh, f*ck [bleep].
    Charlie: Alright, see, like right there. That’s a good example. You’re avoiding the situation by taking a hit of that vape pen.
    Satan: [Demonic voice] [yelling] Enough! I’m not addicted! I could quit my addictive vices any time I want!
    [Devils speak indistinctly, and start to torture Charlie.]
    Devils: Charlie is here forever! (repeats)
    Charlie: Wait! No! No! No! No! No!
    [Charlie gets tortured by the Devils.]
    Devils: Ah ha!
    [Demon-like Bliblies also torture Charlie. Jeremy appears and punches Charlie in the face.]
    Satan: Ha ha! It gives me great joy to see a pathetic thing like you being tortured.
    Charlie: Wait, wait, you’re happy. Seeing me get horribly tortured made you smile.
    Satan: [Regular voice] Oh, well, I guess you're right.
    Charlie: Oh, sweet. So you’re gonna let me go, right?
    Satan: Huh. No. You pissed me the freak off, dude. I’m still gonna torture you forever, man. Forever, man.
    Charlie: No. What? No, that is not fair.
    God: [offscreen] A deal’s a deal! [God enters Hell to save Charlie.] Quickly, Charlie, get on. [Charlie gets on God’s hand, and saves him.]
    Satan: Blast! Foiled again!
    [God exits out of Hell which is then turned back to normal.]
    God: You passed my test, Charlie. By helping the evil devil, you confronted your own problems. I hope you learn from his cool experience. Merry Christmas!
    [God throws Charlie down to Planet Earth, somewhere in the United States.]
    [Charlie flies through the air.]
    [Charlie’s funeral is shown, with Pim, Allan, Glep, Mr. Boss, Dave, Charlie’s own girlfriend, Glep’s girlfriend, a Priest, and another Critter are shown attending.]
    Priest: We gather here to celebrate the life of Charlie Dompler, a noble critter who loved to live, laugh, and love. I understand his boss is here and would like to say a few words.
    The Boss: Charlie, what does it mean, Charlie? You were my everything. World’s  f*cked [bleep] up, man. [Glep and Allan are sad.] Charlie, am I losing my goddamn mind? [Pim sheds a tear.] If it’s gone, where will I find…it? [The Boss drops his microphone, with a feedback squeal]
    Priest: Thank you for those beautiful words, Mr. Boss. Now, finally, we bid farewell to the dearly departed as he is laid to rest. [Charlie’s coffin burials]
    [Charlie crashes into the coffin, an effect is shown. Everyone is covered in yellow goo from Charlie. The latter then revives into a nude Charlie with his privates pixelated.]
    The Boss: It’s a Christmas miracle.
    Pim: Charlie, how is this possible?
    Charlie: Look, I could barely explain the nutty adventure I just went on. So I’m not going to. I don’t-I don't wanna talk about it. I’ve seen the devil.
    Pim: Oh, Charlie, [hugs him] I’m sorry we had that nasty argument.
    Charlie: I’m completely naked. Be careful where your hand goes, dude.
    Narrator/Grandfather Glep: And so that is how Charlie got his groove back. The End. [Grandfather Glep closes the storybook.]
    [The next scene shows an elderly Glep in a wooden house with his grandson sitting on a bear-skinned rug.]
    Glep’s Grandson: That was a wonderful story, Grandfather Glep. But did all of that really happen?
    Grandfather Glep: Yup. Hell is actually real, and Christianity was right all along. Sorry.
    Glep’s Grandson: Oh.
    Grandfather Glep: [Waves his hand at the screen.] Merry Christmas, everyone.
